# Interview Simulation Application

## Project Overview

This project is an **Interview Simulation Application** that allows users to practice job interviews. The application uses **React.js** for the frontend and **Python (Flask)** for the backend, with a machine learning model to evaluate user responses. The AI model analyzes answers to provide feedback on various aspects of the interview process. The frontend is built with React components, styled with CSS, and communicates with the backend to submit answers and fetch evaluation results.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For navigating between different pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the pages and components.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
  
### Backend:
- **Python (Flask)**: Web framework for building the API that serves the frontend.
- **model_ai.py**: The AI model script that processes user responses and provides feedback.
  
### AI Model:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For analyzing and evaluating user responses.
- **Machine Learning**: For training the model to provide feedback on interview performance.

## Frontend Setup

### Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the React Development Server:
To view the app, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Folder Structure:
- `src/components/`: Contains React components like `AboutPage`, `LandingPage`, `QuestionPage`, and `ResultPage`.
- `src/Layout/`: Contains layout components like `MainLayout` that provide the structure for pages.
- `src/style/`: Contains CSS files for each page and component.

## Backend Setup

### Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have Python installed and then install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Flask Server:
Start the backend server by running:

```bash
python app.py
```

The backend will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

## AI Model Integration

The AI model is built to analyze and evaluate the answers provided by the user. The **model_ai.py** script is responsible for processing the user responses, performing natural language processing, and providing feedback based on predefined categories such as technical knowledge, problem-solving ability, and communication skills.

The backend receives the user responses, passes them through the AI model, and sends the evaluation result back to the frontend.

## Components and Pages

### Frontend Components:

- **LandingPage.jsx**: The homepage of the application where users can start their interview simulation.
- **AboutPage.jsx**: A page that explains the purpose of the interview simulation app and how it works.
- **QuestionPage.jsx**: A page that displays interview questions and allows users to submit their responses.
- **ResultPage.jsx**: A page that shows the user's interview results and feedback based on their answers.
- **MainLayout.jsx**: A layout component that wraps the pages with common elements like the header and footer.

### Frontend Styles:

- **LandingPage.css**: The CSS file for styling the `LandingPage.jsx` component.
- **Navbar.css**: The CSS file for styling the navigation bar across the application.
- **QuestionPage.css**: The CSS file for styling the `QuestionPage.jsx` component.
- **ResultPage.css**: The CSS file for styling the `ResultPage.jsx` component.

## Features

- **Interview Simulation**: Users can take a simulated job interview with different types of questions.
- **Real-time Evaluation**: User responses are evaluated in real-time using the AI model.
- **Feedback and Results**: After the interview, the user is presented with feedback based on their answers, including strengths and areas for improvement.
- **Responsive UI**: The application is designed to work across devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **User-friendly Navigation**: Users can easily navigate between the home, interview, and results pages.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Backend**:
    - Navigate to the backend folder and run the Flask server.

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Start the Frontend**:
    - Navigate to the frontend folder and run the React development server.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

3. **Use the Application**:
    - Open the app in a browser (`http://localhost:3000`).
    - Start the interview by answering the questions provided on the `QuestionPage.jsx`.
    - After completing the interview, view your feedback on the `ResultPage.jsx`.
